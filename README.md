Step 1: Update Your App.js.

- In your App.js Create a function to handle
the deletion of categories. This function
should take the category you want to delete
as a parameter (in this case, categoryToDelete).
- Within the handleDeleteCategory function, use
the filter method to create a new array
(updatedCategories) that excludes the
categoryToDelete.
- Update the categories
state with the updatedCategories array
using the setCategories function. To ensure
your changes persist, store the updated
categories in local storage.

Step 2: 

- In your return statement, in the CategoryDropdown 
component pass the necessary props. Then in your
CategoryDropdown.js file, make sure to accept
these props and apply them in your component code.

Step 3: Conditionally Render the Delete Button.

- Inside your {categories.map((category, index)
use conditional rendering to display the delete
button only when the category is not "All". Within
the conditional rendering block, create a button 
element and attach an onClick event handler.

Step 4: Apply Styles to the CategoryDropdown Component.

- In your CategoryDropdown.js file make sure to
apply the class names to the appropriate elements.

Step 5: The dynamic width adjustment for a dropdown.

- In your component, define a state variable to 
store the width of the dropdown container.
- Initialize it with a default value.

Step 6: Calculate Maximum Width.

- Inside the useEffect hook, calculate the maximum
width based on the longest category name.
- You can use the reduce function to find the
maximum width based on the length of 
each category name.

Step 7: Apply Dynamic Width with Inline Style.

- In your JSX, apply the calculated dropdownWidth
to the dropdown container using an inline
style attribute. Ensure that your CSS for
.dropdown-content doesn't set a fixed width
that would override the dynamic width applied
through the inline style.
